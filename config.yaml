      In a previous life, I planned to be an academic research professor with my own lab. I have five years of doctoral training from an interdisciplinary 'Biobehavioral Health' program, and thus broad research training and expertise. 
      
      I now focus on my talent for data analytics, where I am particularly adept at using statistical programming to manage, analyze, and interpret data.
