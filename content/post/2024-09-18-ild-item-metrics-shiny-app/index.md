# ILD-Item Metrics Shiny App

## Context for Development

The ILD (Intensive Longitudinal Design) Item Metrics Shiny App is a web tool designed to address the need for user-friendly, openly accessible tools for researchers (especially those without programming expertise) to explore the psychometric properties and item characteristics of questions used in intensive repeated-measures survey designs (such as daily diaries and experience sampling). 

Despite significant advancements in traditional survey designs and standards, there is still much to learn about those used in intensive, repeated methods applications. The app provides dynamic visualizations and information in a dashboard format driven by real data, including intraclass correlations (ICCs), reliability measures, reporting frequencies, between- and within-person correlations, and offers recommendations and best practices for using scales and items in new studies.

## Demo Video

This video demonstrates key functionalities of a proof-of-concept version of the app developed in collaboration with Dr. Jacqueline Mogle at Clemson University. Dr. Mogle provided the initial idea and ongoing feedback throughout the development process. The demo uses two datasets (one public dataset and one dataset from ongoing primary research). I was responsible for the full development of the demo, including design and features, and using software engineering best practices, such as Git versioning.

The .mp4 video file can be downloaded and viewed, or you can access the Loom-hosted version of the video here:

Full development of the app would include additional and refined features. The demo app was included as a component of a measurement-oriented NIH grant in mid 2024. Full development is dependent on funding.
